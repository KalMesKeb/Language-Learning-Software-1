# Natural Language Learning (Natural Method + Dynamic Inter-Linear Translation)

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an offline, Windows-based language learning software designed specifically to teach English to Amharic speakers. The software will utilize the **Natural Method** for language acquisition, which emphasizes immersion and context-based learning, alongside **Dynamic Inter-Linear Translation (DIT)**, a method that helps learners understand and compare sentence structures across languages.

The software will be fully client-side, meaning all functionalities will be embedded in the application and will not require an active internet connection after installation. Users will have access to interactive vocabulary lists, sentence breakdowns, and all functioning seamlessly offline.

### 1.2 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and effective platform for Amharic-speaking learners to master English. By focusing on immersive learning and sentence breakdown techniques, learners will gain the skills to understand and produce English sentences naturally while also gaining insights into the grammatical structures of both languages.

## 3. System Architecture & Technical Requirements

### 3.1 System Architecture Overview

The software will be developed using Python and designed as a **fully offline, client-side application**. This means that all operations (lesson navigation, vocabulary learning, quizzes, speech recognition, etc.) will be performed locally on the user's machine without any need for an active internet connection.

**Modules:**

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Built using `tkinter` to provide a simple, user-friendly graphical interface for the Windows desktop environment.
   - Language switching between English and Amharic with clear, easy navigation.

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
   - Libraries: `pyttsx3` for offline TTS support for English and local Amharic TTS solutions.
   - Pronunciation of words and sentences by clicking or hovering over them.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Use of `nltk` for local sentence parsing and tokenization to break down English sentences and align them with Amharic structure.
   - Offline analysis tools will handle morphology and grammatical analysis for both English and Amharic.

4. **Database**:
   - **SQLite** for local data storage (vocabulary learned, progress, quiz scores, etc.).
   - All lessons, quizzes, and audio files will be stored locally, making the software fully functional offline.
   - Encrypted user data storage to protect sensitive information.

5. **Audio Management**:
   - Audio files for vocabulary and sentence playback stored locally in `.mp3` or `.wav` format.
   - Local audio synchronization with sentence displays for immersive language learning.

### 3.2 Platform Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7/10/11.
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x.
- **Libraries**:
  - `tkinter` for UI.
  - `pyttsx3` for TTS.
  - `nltk` for NLP.
  - `SQLite` for local database management.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 User Requirements

1. **Registration and Login**:
   - Users should be able to create profiles with personalized settings.

2. **Lesson Navigation**:
   - Users must be able to navigate between different lessons (vocabulary, grammar, sentence building) with ease.
   - A progress bar to show current lesson completion.

3. **Interactive Exercises**:
   - Users must be able to engage in interactive exercises (drag-and-drop, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice) to reinforce learning.
   - Immediate feedback on answers and performance.

4. **Audio Feedback**:
   - Upon clicking on any word or sentence, users should hear both English and Amharic pronunciations.

5. **Dynamic Inter-Linear Translation**:
   - English sentences are displayed, with each word/phrase dynamically aligned with its Amharic counterpart for easy comparison.
   - The software will explain the grammatical roles of words (e.g., subject, verb, object).

### 4.2 System Requirements

1. **Translation Accuracy**:
   - The software should offer accurate translations of English sentences to Amharic based on the local translation corpus.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- The software should be responsive with minimal delays in navigating lessons, quizzes, and exercises.
- Speech synthesis should occur with minimal lag.

### 5.2 Scalability
- The system should handle an increasing amount of content (lessons, vocabulary) as the user progresses.

### 5.3 Reliability
- The software should be stable and free from crashes or freezes, even during offline usage.
- Data should be consistently saved and accessible between sessions.

### 5.4 Security
- User profile data, including progress and preferences, should be encrypted and securely stored locally.
- The software should not store sensitive data in an unprotected manner.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Test Plan

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components (TTS, STT, NLP, etc.) for correctness.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensuring all components (e.g., UI, TTS, translation, quizzes) work seamlessly together.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Testing the software with real users (Amharic speakers learning English) to gather feedback on usability and effectiveness.

### 6.2 Usability Testing
- Evaluate the intuitiveness of the user interface and ease of navigation.
- Test the overall effectiveness of the language immersion experience and Dynamic Inter-Linear Translation.

## 8. Conclusion

This proposal outlines the development of a fully offline, client-side language learning software for Amharic speakers to learn English. By combining the **Natural Method** and **Dynamic Inter-Linear Translation**, the software will offer an engaging, immersive, and comprehensive learning experience. The offline nature of the system ensures that users can continue their learning journey without relying on an internet connection, providing greater flexibility and convenience.
